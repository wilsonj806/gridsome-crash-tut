# Gridsome Remark Tut
## Overview
Gridsome is the Vue version of Gatsby.js essentially. A lot of the patterns are based on Gatsby but with some differences. This tutorial repo is based on Luke Diebold's [Gridsome Remark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ThzHtBnys&list=PLFZAa7EupbB61QMSYFB8YX9qQUKnWxu_M&index=2) tutorial series.
